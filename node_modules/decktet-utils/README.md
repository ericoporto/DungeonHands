### Javascript Decktet Utility Functions

This project includes a small library of functions to support (eventual) HTML5
games based on the Decktet (http://www.decktet.com).

I'm releasing this on GitHub to support another project (decktet-ui-simple),
but I have not yet decided on a dependency management system like bower. So for
now it's just the Javascript file and Jasmine test suite.
