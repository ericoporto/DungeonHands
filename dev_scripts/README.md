# Note on dev_scripts directory

The files here are batch and other scripts that may be useful to run steps on the CI system or at the computer.

Scripts are used in [`appveyor.yml`](https://github.com/ericoporto/ImGi/blob/main/appveyor.yml), in your computer ***please read them before running***.

**`ags-tar.cmd`** is made by Morgan Willcock and available here: https://github.com/morganwillcock/ags-tar

**`AGSModuleExporter.exe`** is made by Michael Rittenhouse and available here: https://github.com/monkey0506/AGSModuleExporter

I am storing a copy of them here for build simplicity.
